My name is Taylor and I am an aspiring data scientist from Houston, Texas. I worked in a retail position and I made a decent living, but it wasn't enough to enrich the life of my son in the ways I wanted. After stumbling upon the Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp through Rice University, I took the application test and scored 100%. I finished the course in March and I've been looking for work since.

I graduated from the boot camp just after the president declared a state of national emergency in response to the covid-19 pandemic. I am making a career change into the field of data science and relying on the skills I learned in the course and I've continued to expand upon since then to succeed. I have developed proficiency in technologies including python JavaScript SQL mongoDB and Excel.

My passion is humanity. I have traveled only a little but I have met people from all over the globe and had meaningful conversations and relationships with them. I find that we are all nearly identical in our needs and our drives. I want to study and learn and discover the patterns in behavior that can be deduced from the ocean of data that's available in the world today. Â Data science could be considered the nitty-gritty of economics or sociology, and that's where my interests lie: in building the tools to enable rigorous statistical analysis of the data to answer the hard questions of society and life therein.
